Learning Python

## Hi There ✌️

### 🤖 Job Hunting bot 🎯

I'm trying to learn Python for a specific reason.

I've worked with JavaScript , NodeJs And ReactJS to build websites for a few years now, and I would concider myself pretty good with these technologies but I thought I might try a new language for this project.

Something that I've never used before, and see how long it would take for me to create a fonctionnal tool.

View that as a personnal Challenge.

This Tool is a Job hunting Bot 🤖.

A bot that will allow me to avoid the painful process of searching for a job , whilst showing my - learning and coding - capacities , and make me learn a new Powerful Tool in the same time.

So if you reading this, I've probably used this bot to find the job you're proposing.

_My point is not to shame the companies or tell them "they're not worth my time", it's just to be more productive. 😁✌️_

### _A.M_ Love ❤️

_The Bot is only available for LinkedIn for the moment and only 7 jobs at a time_
_Indeed / Upwork / Monster Update will come soon_
